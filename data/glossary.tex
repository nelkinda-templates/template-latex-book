    description={A specific class of computer software that provides the low-level control for the specific hardware of a device.
        Firmware can either provide a standardized operating environment for more complex device software, or, for less complex devices, act as the complete operating system of that device.
        As such, it performs all control, monitoring and data manipulation functions}
